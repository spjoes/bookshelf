# bookshelf

This is a revival of [Readarr](https://github.com/Readarr/Readarr). The images
published are configured to use working Goodreads or Hardcover metadata out of
the box.

Bookshelf is an ebook and audiobook collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent
users. It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new books from your favorite
authors and will grab, sort, and rename them. Note that only one type of a
given book is supported. If you want both an audiobook and ebook of a given
book you will need multiple instances.

## Getting Started

The container listens on port 8787 and expects a volume mounted at `/config`.

    docker run -p 8787:8787 -v ~/.config/bookshelf:/config ghcr.io/pennydreadful/bookshelf:hardcover

The `softcover` tags use [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com) as the metadata
provider. The quality of this metadata is generally poor and contains a lot of
slop. However, it is backward-compatible with existing Readarr databases and
functionality like Goodreads list imports should continue to work normally.

The `hardcover` tags use [Hardcover](https://hardcover.app/home) as a metadata
provider. This metadata is higher quality but isn't backward-compatible; if
you're already running Readarr you'll need to redeploy this from scratch.
Goodreads list imports haven't been tested and likely don't work.
